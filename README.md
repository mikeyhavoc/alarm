# alarm

python program
right now designed just for EST

it presents the time in hours and minutes.

you enter the hour:minute
you would like to wake up at 
it then has a designated youtube url which will open at this time.

to turn off you must get up and close it.

further thoughts and design will be designed and implemented later.
